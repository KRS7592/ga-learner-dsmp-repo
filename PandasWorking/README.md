### Project Overview

 Bank Loan Approval Data , checking various metrics using pandas Data Frame


### Learnings from the project

 Lambda functions in pandas,series slicing and indexing , Pandas Indexing , pivot table , data correction accross a data frame for NANs in a single line of code using mean mode or median


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Even though its a small problem approach followed was to write code with as many dynamic variables as possible instead of hard coding various conditions or keys in.


### Challenges faced

 Syntax errors and identification of multiple methods to give the same result , optimization of which is the most robust result in the possible solutions.


### Additional pointers

 All code responds to a basic set of questions that were to be answered using Pandas same can be solved in Excel but without the reciprocity offered by the code.
